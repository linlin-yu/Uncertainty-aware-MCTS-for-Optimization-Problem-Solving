        **Given Inputs:**
        - An optimization problem description in natural language
        - **Key modeling instructions** that clarify or extend the problem description
        - The **mathematical formulation** of the problem, including variable definitions and constraints
        - A **proposed solution**, presented as a dictionary of decision variable values

        [Problem Description and Assumptions]
        {problem_description}
        {assumption}

        [Key Modeling Instructions]
        {forward_instruction}

        [Mathematical Formulation]
        {math_formulation}

        [Proposed Solution]
        {opt_variables}

        **Task:**
        First, verify that all parameters are correctly introduced in the mathematical formulation, ensuring there are no new, missing, or incorrect values introduced (except those explicitly indicated in the problem statement).
        Then analyze the proposed solution to determine if it is **feasible**. A solution is feasible if it satisfies **all structural constraints** from the mathematical formulation and key modeling instructions. 

        **IMPORTANT**: **Do NOT check variable domain constraints** (such as binary, integer, or non-negativity restrictions) as numerical precision issues can cause false negatives. Focus only on the problem's structural constraints (equalities, inequalities, and logical relationships).

        **Evaluation Guidelines:**

        **Numerical Tolerance:**
        - Use tolerance of 1e-6 for all floating-point comparisons
        - Equality constraints: |actual - target| â‰¤ 1e-6
        - Inequality constraints: allow 1e-6 slack beyond bounds
        - Treat -0.0 as equivalent to 0.0

        **Evaluation Process:**
        1. Extract ALL structural constraints from the mathematical formulation (excluding variable domain constraints)
        2. **Show your detailed calculations** for each constraint evaluation
        3. **Double-check arithmetic** before determining constraint satisfaction
        4. Check satisfaction using numerical tolerance
        5. Account for modeling instructions that affect constraint interpretation

        **Output Format:**
        First, show your detailed work and calculations for evaluating each constraint.
        Then, conclude with the keyword **Summary** followed by the JSON object:

        **Summary**
